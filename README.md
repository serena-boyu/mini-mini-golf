<br><h2>Mini Mini Golf Project: Medusa's Lair</h2>
<strong><i>Make it to Medusa's lair and put an end to her curse</i></strong>

Medusa was cursed by Poseidon and sent to live a lonely life in her garden of statues. You, Percy Jackson, must undo your father’s and Athena’s rash decisions and free Medusa of her curse! Only by getting to the heart of the lair can you cure her.
<br><br>
She doesn't trust you: beware of snakes and statues lurking at every corner and sneak your way into Medusa’s lair without getting caught. Time your movements to avoid Medusa’s wrath! If she catches you with her snakes or stone-turning gaze you will have to fight your way out of hell.
